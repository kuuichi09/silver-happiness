# silver-happiness
gp_processing, the name of this project "silver-happiness" was recommended by GitHub.

This just process the genome in text form (query.txt) to the proteins in multiple-fasta form. The 83% of genes start from Met(AUG), and 14% from Val(GUG), 3% from Leu (UUG). This codes the starts from Met and Val.

For compiling,
$ gcc -O2 main_vs.c
and rename the result file a.out to whatever you like.
I made a shell script to process automatically.
